# My-Femap-Scripts
A list of my public Femap scripts.

I've written a number of Femap API macros for productivity and convenience. I'll start to share some of them that might be useful to other people. All are available under various open-source licenses, see the individual repos for more info. Please comment and contribute if you see any room for improvement!

If you don't know how to use macros, see my guide [How to use Femap Scripts](https://github.com/aaronjasso/How_to_use_Femap_Scripts).
