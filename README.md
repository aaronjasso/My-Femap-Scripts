# My-Femap-Scripts
A list of my public Femap scripts.

I've written a number of Femap API macros for productivity and convenience. I'll start to share some of them that might be useful to other people. All are available under various open-source licenses, see the individual repos for more info. Please comment and contribute if you see any room for improvement!

If you don't know how to use macros, see my guide [How to use Femap Scripts](https://github.com/aaronjasso/How_to_use_Femap_Scripts).

**Formatting Note:**
For some reason, the nice consistent indentations I make in the Femap API are sometimes messed up when I upload to Github. Right now I'm focusing on uploading more of my scripts so that others can use them, and I'm not spending much time fixing these odd indentations. I'll probably get around to that eventually. But for now, the code view may look a little wonky. Fortunately, WinWrap Basic ignores whitespace so it will not affect the functionality.
